# # Intuition
# Given a positive integer n, returns the number of set bits in its binary representation (also known as the Hamming weight).
# 計算正整數 n 的二進位表示中有多少個1，也就是 Hamming weight

# # Approach
# Brian Kernighan’s Algorithm (定義：一種計算 Hamming weight 的演算法)
# REF: 

# # Complexity
# - Time complexity:O(log n)
# - Space complexity:O(log n)

# language: Python
